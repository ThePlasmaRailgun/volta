# volta
An easy-to-use version of the Volta Deep Style Transfer script made by Victor Espinoza (vic8760).

This is file storage for what will hopefully be a Google Colaboratory Notebook where you can run Vonta on a Tesla K80! These files are required by Volta to work.

It is also possible I will modify the original shell script to take command line arguments, and potentially break-out more of the variables to tune from the terminal entry line. Maybe.
